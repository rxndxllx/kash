## 🧠 Why I Am Building KASH (Personal Note)
KASH began from my own desire to better understand my financial behavior. Most existing finance apps cover the basics, like recording transactions and calculating balances. KASH doesn't stop there.

I’m no financial expert, so I wanted a tool that could do more than track—I wanted clarity. AI-driven insights feel like the missing piece. That’s why KASH is designed not just to record data, but to help users (including myself) make smarter financial decisions.
